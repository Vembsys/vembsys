                <p>A motor controller is a device or group of devices that can coordinate in a predetermined manner the performance of an electric motor.[1] A motor controller might include a manual or automatic means for starting and stopping the motor, selecting forward or reverse rotation, selecting and regulating the speed, regulating or limiting the torque, and protecting against overloads and electrical faults. Motor controllers may use electromechanical switching, or may use power electronics devices to regulate the speed and direction of a motor.</p>

            <p>The Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system is an advanced technology used in modern internal combustion engines to enhance performance, efficiency, and emissions control. Replacing traditional mechanical systems, EFI uses electronic controls to precisely manage fuel delivery. At its core, the EFI system includes an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), which acts as the system's brain by processing input from various sensors and adjusting fuel injectors accordingly. These sensors—such as the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor, Oxygen (O2) sensor, Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), and Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor—provide crucial data on engine parameters like air intake and temperature.

                <p>An air purifier or air cleaner is a device which removes contaminants from the air in a room to improve indoor air quality. These devices are commonly marketed as being beneficial to allergy sufferers and asthmatics, and at reducing or eliminating second-hand tobacco smoke.

                  The commercially graded air purifiers are manufactured as either small stand-alone units or larger units that can be affixed to an air handler unit (AHU) or to an HVAC unit found in the medical, industrial, and commercial industries. Air purifiers may also be used in industry to remove impurities from air before processing. Pressure swing adsorbers or other adsorption techniques are typically used for this.</p>
